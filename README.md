# Memory Card Game

This will be a basic memory card game. There will be even numbers of cards to match letters A-H.

## Instructions

Click on each card to flip. If two card are matched they will stay face up. If two cards are clicked that do not match, they will turn face down again. Once all cards are matched and face up, the board will reset and mix with an additional set of cards to match.

## Next Steps

I would like to create a visual animation for the cards flipping over, instead of just showing the letters. I would also like to create levels, where after each 'win', more cards are added to the board.
